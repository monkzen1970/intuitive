# This is the YAML template for a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that can be used to validate,
# scan, and deploy Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC). The proposed CI/CD pipeline will consist of three jobs:
#
# terraform-validate: This job will validate the Terraform code.
# terraform-scan: This job will scan the Terraform code for potential security issues using a tool like Checkov or Tfsec.
# terraform-apply: This job will apply the Terraform configuration to deploy your infrastructure.
#
# Here is a simplified example of such a GitHub Actions workflow.
# It is defined in a file called main.yaml located in the .github/workflows directory of your repository.
# Please note that you need to add your own environment variables, secrets and modify the steps to match your requirements:
