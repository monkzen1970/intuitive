Below you will find the Terraform modules to build a basic AWS environment with a VPC, S3, subnet, and 2 EC2 instances with EBS. 
This example applies Terraform best practices including modularization, use of remote state, and variable definition.

Firstly, create the necessary modules. 
A module is essentially a container for multiple resources that are used together. 
We'll have the modules for VPC, subnet, S3 bucket, EC2 instances, and EBS volumes.

This is a very simplified example and a real-world scenario would be much more complex. It is also important to note that you should include variables.tf and outputs.tf files in your module and root directories to properly configure input variables and return outputs.

This example assumes you've already configured your AWS provider and backend. Make sure you've done so before using this code.

In the end, be sure to validate and test your templates carefully in a safe environment before using them in a production setting.
