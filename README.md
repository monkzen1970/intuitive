Before diving into the Python code, let's review the reference architecture. 
We're going to create a CloudFormation stack using AWS CDK that includes:

* A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
* Two subnets (public and private)
* Two EC2 instances (one for each subnet)
* An S3 bucket
* Each EC2 instance will have EBS (Elastic Block Storage)

I'll provide a high-level example of how to create each stack. 
It's a Python script which uses AWS CDK, which should be installed and configured with appropriate 
AWS access credentials.

Here's what these files and directories typically contain:

* **app.py**: This is the entry point for your application. It defines the AWS CDK app and the stacks that form part of the app.

* **cdk.json**: This file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

* **requirements.txt** and **setup.py**: These files are used to manage Python dependencies for your CDK app.

* **README.md**: A markdown file where you can provide documentation for your project.

* **.gitignore**: This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

* **/networking**, **/compute**, and **/storage**: These directories contain the Python scripts for your AWS CDK stacks.

Each stack directory contains an __init__.py file (making it a Python package) 
and a Python script that defines the stack.
