Terraform setup for Microsoft Azure. In Azure, the equivalent to AWS's EC2 instances are Virtual Machines, 
the equivalent of an AWS VPC is an Azure Virtual Network, and the equivalent of an AWS EBS volume is an Azure Managed Disk.

Please note that you need to authenticate to Azure using either a Service Principal or the Azure CLI when running Terraform. 
We'll use a Service Principal for these examples.
