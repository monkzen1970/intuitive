To build the Docker image based on the Dockerfile, follow these steps:

Create a file named Dockerfile and copy the provided Dockerfile content into it.
Open a terminal or command prompt in the same directory where the Dockerfile is located.
Run the following command to build the Docker image:
````
docker build -t my_image_name .
````
Replace my_image_name with the desired name for your Docker image.

Docker will start building the image, which may take some time depending on your internet connection 
and system resources. It will execute each instruction in the Dockerfile and create layers for caching 
purposes.
Once the build process is complete, you will see output indicating a successful build.
You can verify that the image has been built by running docker images command,
````
docker images
````
and you should see your newly created image in the list.
Now you have successfully built your Docker image based on the provided Dockerfile. 
You can use this image to run containers with the desired dependencies and tools installed.

To create and start a container from the Docker image you have built, you can follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Run the following command to create a container from your image:
````
docker create --name my_container_name my_image_name
````
Replace my_container_name with the desired name for your container, and my_image_name with the name of the Docker image you built in the previous step.

To start the container, run the following command:
````
docker start my_container_name
````
Replace my_container_name with the name you assigned to the container.

The container will start running, and you can interact with it if needed.
You can check the status of your running containers by running docker ps command. 
This will display a list of running containers along with their details, 
such as container ID, image name, status, and more.

Remember to adjust the names according to your preference. By default, 
Docker will allocate a random name for the container if you don't specify one explicitly.
